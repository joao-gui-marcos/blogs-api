## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

In this project, I developed an API and a database for producing content for a blog.

I developed an application in Node.js using the sequelize package to make a CRUD of posts:

1.  I developed endpoints that are connected to the database following REST principles;

2.  To make a post you need a user and a login, so the relationship between user and post was worked on;

3.  Categories were used for the posts, thus working the relationship of posts to categories and categories to posts.

# Mandatory Requirements

## 1 - Create migrations for the tables`users`,`categories`,`blog_posts`,`posts_categories`

-   This test will make a connection to the database using the test configuration from the file`src/config/config.js`;
-   Your`migrations`they must be in the correct directory and respect the nomenclature requested in the requirement;
-   Your`migrations`must respect the_Entity-Relationship diagram_it's the_format of entities_, as described in the section on[ER and Entities Diagram](#diagrama).
-   All tables and columns must be in`snake_case`

-   **[It will be validated that it is possible to do an INSERT and a SELECT on the users table]**
    -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`users`;
    -   The evaluator will select the same data from the table`users`.

-   **[It will be validated that it is possible to do an INSERT and a SELECT on the categories table]**
    -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`categories`;
    -   The evaluator will select the same data from the table`categories`.

-   **[It will be validated that, from an INSERT in users, it is possible to make an INSERT and a SELECT in the blog_posts table]**
    -   Given the`blog_posts`it has**a foreign key**`user_id`:
        -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`users`;
    -   Thus:
        -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`blog_posts`;
        -   The evaluator will select the same data from the table`blog_posts`.

-   **[It will be validated that, from INSERTs in users, categories and blog_posts, it is possible to make an INSERT and a SELECT in the posts_categories table]**
    -   Given the`posts_categories`it has**a primary key made up of two foreign keys**, respectively,`post_id`,`category_id`:
        -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`users`;
        -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`categories`;
        -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`blog_posts`;
    -   Thus:
        -   The evaluator will insert an example data in the table`posts_categories`;
        -   The evaluator will select the same data from the table`posts_categories`.

## 2 - Create the model`User`em`src/models/User.js`with the correct properties

-   Your`model`it must be in the correct directory and respect the nomenclature requested in the requirement;
-   Your`model`must respect the_Entity-Relationship diagram_it's the_format of entities_, as described in the section on[ER and Entities Diagram](#diagrama);
-   The properties can be in`camelCase`with`underscored`for`true`üáßüá∑ That is, when data is entered or selected via`model`must be in`camelCase`, but when the_queries_go to the bank the fields of the columns must be in`snake_case`.
-   Your`model`it must be developed in a functional format, that is, it cannot be a class.

## :warning: Validating token on requests

-   After we have made the requirement to create`users`and the requirement of`login`, some requirements below will need this prior authentication, so that it is possible to consume the endpoint;
-   Every requirement that needs to validate the`token`will have the symbol ‚òù;
-   **‚ú® Hint:**If it's something we're going to use in more than one route, can we separate it somewhere that starts with`M`of`middleware`? üòú
